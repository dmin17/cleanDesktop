# Do you have hundreds of screenshots on your desktop, and dont feel like manually moving them????
## I did! So I wrote this very short python script to store all of the screenshots into a folder name screenshot. 

1. Clone this repo in your root directory (1 level above your desktop directory)

    $ git clone https://github.com/jsboss5/cleanDesktop

2. Run it

    $ python3 cleanDesktop.py
